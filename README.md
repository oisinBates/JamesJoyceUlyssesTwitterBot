# James_Joyce_Twitter_Bot
Twitter bot using the Tweepy library. Tweeting random quotes from James Joyce's Ulysses

It's been said that Joyce's Ulysses is so cryptic and dense, that the reader could open the book at a random page each time
and find something new.
In the spirit of this theory, one of consuming Ulysses in random chunks rather than start to finish, this twitter bot will 
tweet random quotations from Joyce's novel.
